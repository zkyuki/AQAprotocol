## Project Description
This project is used for the data hub for Lens apps' personalization. Privacy-sensitive data can be used for good personalization. Especially in a web3 social, such kind of data is important for UX. But almost all such data is closed in one app and web3 social is still in a early stage, so one app could have a few amount of data. So we overcome the dilenma between privacy and good UX.

## How it's Made
This project used Lit protocol to allow users to control access to the user's private data such as viewing history, click, sharing on Lens Protocol. Lens and Lit integrations don't support Lit action, so it was difficult. Also, it used ChatGPT to categoraize the content users viewed for personalization. chatGPT doesn't support Typescript officially, but Lens app uses Typescript, so it was difficult.
